# Exploratons with concentric RGB LED rings 

This is software and other artifacts for use with concentric RGB LED rings.

I'm using the Mokungit device (93 WS2812B RGB LEDs), which I've wired as a continuous string.

I got mine at Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EUAKLT0) but you can find these elsewhere as well.

This utilizes the port of the Adafruit NeoPixel library for the Particle ecosystem:
