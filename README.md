# Concentric RGB LED Rings

This is software and other artifacts for use with concentric RGB LED rings.

I'm using the Mokungit device which has 93 WS2812B RGB LEDs, which I've wired as a continuous string.

I got mine at Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EUAKLT0) but you can find these elsewhere as well.
